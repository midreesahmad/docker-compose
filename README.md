# docker-compose
This repo contains all materia related to docker compose projects. 

Deployed node 3 tier application. There are three containers. One is container app-code and other are mongodb and mongo-express.
One thing to remeber that ip-address is need to update according to platform where app is going to deploy. Like as I did it on ec2 machine so have to enter ec2 ip in app/index.html file.
